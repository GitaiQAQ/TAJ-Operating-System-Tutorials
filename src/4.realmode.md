Real mode
=====

## Introduction

Real mode as its name suggest is real, that means everything is real in it. The memory which is addressed is real i.e. it really exists at the addressed location. The real mode was put into the processors after 80286 so that they run programs of their predecessor and also for loading the operating system and switching into the Protected mode.

In real addressing mode the memory is addressed by 16bits of addresses. That is you can address at most (2^16=) 1 MB of physical memory.
